# DictionaryScraper

Tool for Polish (later to be extended for English speakers) people learning Japanese.
It's a command line application that makes building mining decks in Anki or other flashcard programs easier and faster. Currenty, when given a word the user is looking for, it looks it up in japonski-pomocnik.pl, displays found words to the user and lets them choose from among them words the user wishes to save, and the specific meanings of those words. Then it appends them to CSV file specified in the configuration, that can be used later to import words in bulk to the user's flashcard deck.
It speeds up the process of building a mining deck because this way the user doesn't have to open the browser at the dictionary page and manually copy words, field by field, to anki, every time they wish to look up meanings of an encountered word and save it.
